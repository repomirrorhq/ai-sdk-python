# Current Session TODO List - Provider Expansion Focus

## Session Goal: Continue Major Provider Expansion
**Focus**: Port additional high-value providers from TypeScript AI SDK to expand ecosystem

## Already Implemented Providers ‚úÖ
- **OpenAI** - Complete multimodal provider (text, image, speech, transcription, embeddings)
- **Anthropic** - Claude models with tool calling and advanced reasoning
- **Google** - Gemini models with multimodal support and safety settings
- **Azure** - Azure OpenAI integration with custom endpoints
- **Amazon Bedrock** - 31 models across 7 families with AWS SigV4 authentication
- **Mistral** - 15+ models with European AI leadership and advanced reasoning
- **Groq** - Ultra-fast inference provider with optimized hardware
- **Together** - Open-source model provider with community models

## Next Priority Providers (This Session) üéØ

### High-Value Targets
1. **Cohere Provider** - Enterprise text processing and embeddings leader
2. **Perplexity Provider** - Search-augmented generation capabilities  
3. **DeepSeek Provider** - High-performance reasoning models
4. **Cerebras Provider** - Ultra-fast inference with specialized hardware

### Medium-Value Targets  
5. **Fireworks Provider** - High-performance model hosting platform
6. **Replicate Provider** - Access to model marketplace and community models
7. **XAI Provider** - Grok models from Elon Musk's xAI

## Success Criteria üìã
- Each provider should have 90%+ feature parity with TypeScript version
- Comprehensive examples demonstrating key features
- Full type safety with Pydantic models
- Production-ready error handling and validation
- Integration with existing AI SDK architecture and middleware
- Proper streaming support where applicable
- Integration tests covering main functionality

## Technical Standards üèóÔ∏è
- Follow existing Python AI SDK patterns and conventions
- Use async/await throughout for proper async handling
- Implement comprehensive streaming support where applicable
- Add detailed docstrings with examples and usage patterns
- Maintain type safety with Pydantic models and type hints
- Include proper error handling, validation, and logging
- Support integration with existing middleware system
- Provide clear commit messages with scope and impact

## Expected Session Outcome üéØ
By the end of this session, we should have:
- 3-4 additional major providers fully implemented
- Comprehensive examples for each new provider
- Integration tests validating functionality
- Proper documentation and API integration
- Total provider count increased from 8 to 11-12
- Significant increase in model availability across different use cases
