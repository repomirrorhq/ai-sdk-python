# Current Session Todos

## Session Goal
Start the ai-sdk-python project by setting up the foundation and beginning Phase 1 work.

## Immediate Tasks
- [x] Analyze ai-sdk TypeScript repository structure
- [x] Create long-term plan document
- [ ] Set up Python project structure (pyproject.toml, src layout)
- [ ] Implement core provider interfaces
- [ ] Set up basic error hierarchy
- [ ] Create initial streaming abstractions
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Port first core utility functions
- [ ] Begin work on generateText() function
- [ ] Set up basic OpenAI provider implementation

## Current Focus
**Phase 1.1: Project Setup** - Creating the foundational Python package structure and core abstractions that everything else will build upon.

## Notes
- Starting with empty ai-sdk-python repository
- Following modern Python practices (uv, ruff, pyproject.toml)
- Prioritizing TypeScript functionality parity
- Using Pydantic for schemas and validation
- httpx for async HTTP client
