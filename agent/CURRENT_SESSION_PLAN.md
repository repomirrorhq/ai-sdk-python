# Current Session Plan - Groq & Together AI Provider Implementation

## Session Goal üéØ
Implement Groq and Together AI providers, expanding ai-sdk-python to support high-speed inference and open-source model hosting platforms.

## Session Status: IN PROGRESS üöß

### Current Task Priority
Based on the TypeScript ai-sdk analysis, the next highest priority providers are:

1. **Groq Provider** üöÄ - High-speed inference for LLaMA, Mixtral, and other models
2. **Together AI Provider** ü§ù - Popular open-source model hosting platform  
3. **Fireworks Provider** ‚ö° - Fast inference for open-source models
4. **Cerebras Provider** üß† - Cerebras AI inference platform

### Why These Providers Are Important
- **Groq**: Extremely fast inference (100+ tokens/sec) for popular open-source models
- **Together AI**: Major platform hosting 100+ open-source models with competitive pricing
- **Fireworks**: High-performance inference for Llama, Code Llama, and other models
- **Cerebras**: Specialized hardware for ultra-fast model inference

## Current Implementation Strategy

### Groq Provider Implementation Plan
Groq uses OpenAI-compatible API, so we can extend our existing OpenAI infrastructure:

1. **Base Architecture**: Extend OpenAI models with Groq-specific configurations
2. **Authentication**: Simple API key authentication  
3. **Models**: Support for Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2, Mixtral, Gemma models
4. **Features**: Text generation, streaming, tool calling, transcription
5. **Specialization**: High-speed inference optimization

### Together AI Provider Implementation Plan
Together AI also uses OpenAI-compatible API with extensions:

1. **Base Architecture**: Extend OpenAI-compatible infrastructure
2. **Authentication**: API key authentication
3. **Models**: 100+ open-source models (Llama, Mixtral, Code Llama, etc.)
4. **Features**: Text generation, streaming, embeddings, image generation
5. **Specialization**: Open-source model focus with competitive pricing

3. **URL Handling**: Provider-specific base URLs and endpoints
4. **Error Handling**: Provider-specific error mapping
5. **Examples**: Comprehensive usage demonstrations
6. **Tests**: Full integration test coverage

## Expected Impact üìä

### After This Session
- **Provider Count**: 6 major providers (OpenAI + Anthropic + Google + Azure + Groq + Together AI)
- **Market Coverage**: ~80% of enterprise AI use cases covered
- **Performance Options**: High-speed (Groq) and cost-effective (Together AI) alternatives
- **Model Variety**: Access to 150+ models across all providers
- **Open Source**: Strong support for open-source model ecosystem

### Code Metrics Projection

- **Total Project**: ~10,000+ lines of production Python
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites for both providers
- **Examples**: Full-featured usage demonstrations

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

1. **Groq Provider**: ‚úÖ Complete implementation with high-speed inference support
2. **Together AI Provider**: ‚úÖ Complete implementation with open-source model support
3. **API Integration**: ‚úÖ Proper API integration with authentication and error handling
4. **Examples & Tests**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive example files and test suites
5. **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Clear usage documentation and provider registration
6. **Performance**: ‚úÖ Optimized for each provider's strengths (speed vs. cost)

## Project Status Update

### Current Phase: 4.1 - High-Performance Provider Expansion
- **OpenAI Provider**: ‚úÖ Complete with full feature set
- **Anthropic Provider**: ‚úÖ Complete with Claude model support
- **Google Provider**: ‚úÖ Complete with Gemini model support
