# AI SDK TypeScript to Python Porting Analysis and Plan

## Current State Analysis

### TypeScript AI SDK Structure
The TypeScript ai-sdk is a comprehensive monorepo with the following key packages:
- **Core package (`packages/ai/`)**: Main SDK with generate-text, stream-text, generate-object, etc.
- **Provider packages**: Individual packages for each provider (openai, anthropic, google, etc.)
- **Framework-specific packages**: react, svelte, vue, angular for UI integration
- **Utility packages**: provider-utils, provider, langchain, llamaindex adapters
- **Specialized packages**: rsc (React Server Components), gateway, etc.

### Python AI SDK Current State
The Python version has a good foundation with:
- ✅ Core structure implemented (`src/ai_sdk/`)
- ✅ Basic generate_text, stream_text, generate_object functionality
- ✅ Tool system with decorators
- ✅ Agent system
- ✅ Registry and middleware systems
- ✅ Multiple provider implementations (openai, anthropic, google, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive examples directory

### Key Differences to Address
1. **Package Structure**: TS uses separate packages per provider, Python uses modules
2. **Async Patterns**: TS uses Promises/streams, Python uses async/await + AsyncIterator
3. **Type Systems**: TS uses TypeScript, Python uses Pydantic + type hints
4. **UI Integration**: TS has React/Vue/Svelte packages, Python doesn't need these

## Priority Features to Port

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Enhanced Generate Text/Object**: Missing features from TS version
2. **Streaming Improvements**: Better streaming patterns and error handling
3. **Tool Calling Enhancements**: More sophisticated tool calling patterns
4. **Provider Coverage**: Ensure all TS providers are available in Python
5. **Middleware System**: More comprehensive middleware patterns
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error types and handling

### Medium Priority (Advanced Features)
1. **Agent System Improvements**: Multi-step agent workflows
2. **Registry Enhancements**: Better provider registry management
3. **Caching and Telemetry**: Advanced middleware features
4. **File Handling**: Better support for images, audio, documents
5. **Batch Operations**: Efficient batch processing

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Framework Integrations**: FastAPI, Django integrations
2. **Testing Utilities**: Comprehensive testing helpers
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs from TypeScript docs

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Parity (Current Focus)
- [ ] Review and enhance generate_text/stream_text implementations
- [ ] Improve generate_object/stream_object with latest TS patterns
- [ ] Enhance tool calling system
- [ ] Add missing provider implementations
- [ ] Improve error handling and types

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Enhanced agent system with multi-step workflows
- [ ] Advanced middleware patterns
- [ ] Caching and telemetry improvements
- [ ] Better streaming patterns

### Phase 3: Testing and Polish
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation improvements

## Current Gaps to Address

### Missing Features from TypeScript Version
1. **Smooth Streaming**: Better streaming user experience
2. **Advanced Tool Patterns**: Dynamic tools, tool repair functions
3. **Multi-step Workflows**: Better support for multi-turn interactions
4. **File Generation**: Support for generated files/images in responses
5. **UI Message Stream**: Structured message streaming for UIs

### Provider Coverage Gaps
Most providers are implemented, but need to verify feature parity:
- ✅ OpenAI, Anthropic, Google - Good coverage
- ⚠️ Specialized providers may need feature updates
- ❓ Need to verify all provider-specific features are implemented

## Next Steps
1. Start with core functionality improvements
2. Systematically go through TypeScript packages and port missing features
3. Add comprehensive tests for each ported feature
4. Maintain commit-per-file workflow for tracking progress
5. Use agent directory for planning and progress tracking

## Success Metrics
- Feature parity with TypeScript version for core functionality
- All examples working correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Good performance characteristics
- Clear documentation and examples
