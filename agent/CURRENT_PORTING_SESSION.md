# Current Porting Session - Aug 23, 2025

## Session Goals

Based on analysis of the TypeScript ai-sdk vs Python implementation, the Python version has achieved excellent coverage with 25+ providers and 90%+ feature parity. However, there are some remaining opportunities:

### Primary Goal: Port RevAI Provider
**Priority: High** - RevAI is a transcription service provider that exists in TypeScript but not Python

**What RevAI provides:**
- High-quality speech-to-text transcription
- Part of the major transcription provider ecosystem (alongside AssemblyAI, Deepgram)
- Simple API focused on machine transcription models

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `/src/ai_sdk/providers/revai/` directory structure
2. Port `revai-provider.ts` to `provider.py`
3. Port `revai-transcription-model.ts` to `transcription_model.py`
4. Create type definitions in `types.py`
5. Add RevAI to main exports
6. Create comprehensive example
7. Write tests

### Secondary Goals (Time Permitting)

1. **Enhanced Testing Framework**
   - Add comprehensive integration tests for existing providers
   - Performance benchmarks
   
2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update provider list documentation
   - Create provider comparison guide

3. **Framework Integration Packages**
   - FastAPI integration package
   - Django integration helpers

## RevAI Provider Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
ai-sdk-python/src/ai_sdk/providers/revai/
├── __init__.py
├── provider.py           # Main provider implementation
├── transcription_model.py # Transcription model implementation
└── types.py              # Type definitions and API models
```

### Key Features to Port
- Bearer token authentication
- Machine transcription model
- Async transcription support
- Error handling for RevAI-specific errors
- Integration with base transcription model interface

### Success Criteria
- [ ] RevAI provider successfully imported
- [ ] Transcription functionality working
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Example demonstrating usage
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Expected Session Outcome

By end of session:
- **+1 new provider** (RevAI)
- **26+ total providers** (was 25+)
- **Complete transcription ecosystem** (AssemblyAI, Deepgram, RevAI, etc.)
- **No regressions** in existing functionality

This brings us closer to 95%+ feature parity with the TypeScript version.
