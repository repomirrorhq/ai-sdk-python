# AI SDK Python Porting Session Continuation
*August 23, 2025 - New Session*

## Current Status Summary
Based on the existing session plan, the ai-sdk-python implementation has achieved **93% provider parity** with comprehensive core functionality, but is missing critical production components.

## Priority Analysis
1. **Gateway Provider** ‚ùå **CRITICAL** - Essential for production deployments
2. **OpenAI-Compatible Provider** ‚ùå **HIGH** - Enables local models and custom endpoints
3. **Directory Structure** üîß **MEDIUM** - groq and together need proper structure

## Today's Session Goals

### Primary: Implement Gateway Provider
**Goal**: Port the Vercel AI Gateway provider for model routing and load balancing
- Analyze TypeScript gateway implementation in `/packages/gateway/`
- Port gateway configuration and routing logic
- Implement model switching, load balancing, caching
- Create comprehensive tests and examples

### Secondary: Implement OpenAI-Compatible Provider  
**Goal**: Port the generic OpenAI-compatible provider
- Analyze TypeScript implementation in `/packages/openai-compatible/`
- Port flexible endpoint configuration
- Support local models (Ollama, LMStudio)
- Create tests for various scenarios

### Tertiary: Fix Directory Structure
**Goal**: Standardize provider structure
- Move groq.py to groq/ directory
- Move together.py to togetherai/ directory
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with analysis** - Deep dive into TypeScript implementations
2. **Port incrementally** - Gateway first, then OpenAI-compatible
3. **Test thoroughly** - Comprehensive testing for each component
4. **Commit frequently** - After each major component completion
5. **Document changes** - Update examples and documentation

## Success Metrics
- Gateway Provider successfully routes between multiple models
- OpenAI-Compatible Provider connects to local Ollama/LMStudio
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New components achieve 90%+ test coverage
- Provider parity increases from 93% to 98%

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with basic functionality, expand iteratively
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Test backward compatibility thoroughly
- Document breaking changes carefully

Let's begin with analyzing the Gateway Provider implementation.
