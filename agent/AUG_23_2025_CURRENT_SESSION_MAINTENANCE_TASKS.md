# AI SDK Python - Current Session Maintenance Tasks
## Date: August 23, 2025

## Session Objective
Continue maintenance and improvement of the ai-sdk-python repository, focusing on keeping parity with TypeScript AI SDK and enhancing Python-specific features.

## Current Repository Status
The Python AI SDK repository appears to be in excellent condition based on recent commits:
- Last commit: "docs(agent): complete maintenance session - repository verified excellent"
- Repository has 95%+ feature parity with TypeScript AI SDK
- 25+ providers implemented
- Comprehensive core functionality
- Advanced features like MCP, agents, middleware

## Session Tasks Priority

### Priority 1: Repository Analysis & Gap Assessment
1. **Compare Latest TypeScript Changes**
   - Check for any new commits in TypeScript repo since last sync
   - Identify any new features, providers, or improvements
   - Assess what needs to be ported

2. **Code Quality Review**
   - Review recent code changes for quality
   - Check test coverage
   - Validate documentation

### Priority 2: Maintenance & Updates
1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Check if any Python dependencies need updating
   - Ensure compatibility with latest versions
   
2. **Test Coverage**
   - Run test suite to ensure everything passes
   - Identify and fix any failing tests
   - Add tests for any uncovered code paths

### Priority 3: Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Profile critical code paths
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Implement optimizations where beneficial

2. **Python-Specific Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling with Python best practices
   - Better async/await patterns
   - Improved type hints and annotations

### Priority 4: Documentation & Examples
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Ensure all features are documented
   - Update examples to show latest capabilities
   - Add any missing guides

2. **Example Enhancements**
   - Create more practical examples
   - Add integration examples
   - Showcase advanced features

## Expected Outcomes
- Repository maintains excellent quality and parity with TypeScript
- All code passes tests and quality checks
- Documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive
- Any identified gaps are addressed

## Next Steps
Start with Priority 1 tasks to assess current state and identify specific work needed.
