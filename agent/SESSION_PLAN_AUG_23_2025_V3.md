# AI SDK Python Porting Session Plan - August 23, 2025 (v3)
*Session Implementation Strategy*

## Current Status Assessment
Based on README.md and existing agent documents:
- ✅ Python implementation claims 100% provider parity (29 providers)
- ✅ Core functionality complete (generate_text, stream_text, generate_object, etc.)
- ✅ Advanced features (middleware, agent system, tools)
- Previous session plan mentioned Gateway and OpenAI-Compatible as missing

## Session Goals
1. **Verify Current Implementation Status**
   - Audit existing provider implementations
   - Check for any gaps or incomplete features
   - Validate claim of 100% provider parity

2. **Identify Highest Impact Missing Components**
   - Gateway provider (if still missing)
   - OpenAI-compatible provider (if still missing)
   - Any core functionality gaps
   - Testing gaps

3. **Port Missing Critical Components**
   - Focus on highest impact missing pieces
   - Ensure production readiness
   - Add comprehensive tests (80/20 rule: 80% implementation, 20% testing)

4. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Update examples for newly ported features
   - Ensure each new component has working examples

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Analysis (30 minutes)
1. Examine current provider implementations in `/src/ai_sdk/providers/`
2. Check TypeScript gateway implementation at `/packages/gateway/`
3. Check TypeScript openai-compatible implementation at `/packages/openai-compatible/`
4. Identify what's actually missing vs what's documented as missing

### Phase 2: Priority Implementation (2-3 hours)
Based on findings, implement highest priority missing components:
- Gateway provider (if missing)
- OpenAI-compatible provider (if missing)
- Any critical core functionality gaps

### Phase 3: Testing and Examples (30-60 minutes)
- Add end-to-end tests for new components
- Create working examples
- Validate integration with existing system

### Phase 4: Commit and Documentation (15 minutes)
- Commit each major component completion
- Push changes to maintain progress
- Update session completion document

## Success Criteria
- All claimed providers are actually implemented and functional
- Any missing critical components are ported
- Working examples demonstrate new functionality
- Tests validate implementation correctness

## Notes
- Follow instruction: "Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit"
- Use 80/20 rule: spend more time on actual porting than testing
- Store progress and plans in ai-sdk-python/agent/ directory
